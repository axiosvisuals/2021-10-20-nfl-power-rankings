## 2021-10-20 NFL Power Rankings

![alt](/src/fallbacks/2021-10-20-nfl-power-rankings-fallback.png)

This project was created with `generator-axios`, Axios' yeoman generator for making static interactive graphics that can be embedded in our news stream. This documentation will help you work with the graphics rig to make awesome internet things.

**Note** — You may also want to look at the documentation for the generator for some additional understanding of what each of the files in this project does and how they all work together.

## Configuration

Most of this configuration should be accomplished already if you set up this project with `yo axios`. If you want to understand more of what's happening, here's some information.

The primary place to configure your project is `project.config.js` in the root directory. This is where you define where on S3 your project will live (this is important for how the rig handles static URLs when building for production). There is also some configuration stuff that happens in `/gulp/config.js` so if you're changing the names of folders or putting things where the rig doesn't expect them to be, that might be where you can fix that problem.

#### Publishing to S3

Once you've configured your AWS credentials, you can publish using the command

`gulp publish`

## Gulp

For more information, type `gulp --tasks`. To edit, see `gulpfile.js`

### `gulp build`

Creates your project. You can run `gulp` to generate the version of your project to put on S3.

### `gulp serve`

Sets up a local server run out of `.tmp`. Watches your Sass, Handlebars and Javascript files and updates live in the browser.

### `gulp publish`

If you've set up your AWS credentials correctly and have the proper s3 configuration in `project.config.js` then this command will automatically run the production build script and deploy the s3 folder you specified.

You'll be prompted to indicate whether you want fallbacks to be created before publishing. For this to work, you'll need to have `gulp serve` running in parallel - the fallbacks are taken from the current dev version.

### `gulp lint`

Run linters over your scripts and styles to make sure ther are no errors.

### Setup functions

To run them all, `gulp setup`

#### `gulp setup:aws`

Installs `awscli` and begins the init function.

##### Setting your Credentials

To publish to S3 you'll need to create a `default` profile in your `~/.aws/credentials` file. You will need to have the aws command line tools installed to do this. To set up your credentials, simply run:

```bash
$ aws configure --profile default
AWS Access Key ID [None]: [PUT YOUR ACCESS_KEY HERE]
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: [PUT YOUR SECRET_ACCESS_KEY HERE]
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: text
```

#### `gulp setup:lint`

Installs eslint and stylelint.

#### `gulp setup:imgmin`

Installs imgmin for optimizing images.

## Scripts

### Analytics

#### setupVisualsAnalytics

`setupVisualsAnalytics()`

Accepts no parameters, returns `undefined`. Necessary to call before attempting to record user interactions.

#### trackEvent

`trackEvent(action, label (optional), value (optional))`

Accepts three parameters and returns `undefined`. To be placed inside an event listener.

- _action_: a string describing the event, e.g. scroll, tap, or graphic-visible
- _label_: an optional string describing the event, e.g. clicked-dropdown
- _value_: an option integer describing the event. useful for tracking time, e.g. 200

### ES6 and beyond

The generator comes with a file in `src/js/setup.js` which imports polyfills for newer JS methods like `Object.assign`. To ensure your code works in older browsers, or if you'd like to experiment with different methods, double-check setup.js.

If you need to add an additional polyfills, visit the [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) for a list of features you can use and polyfill in your project.

## Examples

## Utils

### Google Docs

#### Setting your Credentials

- Log in to <https://console.developers.google.com/>, you should see a project called "Visuals Rig Copyflow" (at the top left next to "Google APIs") (If not, ask the devs to set you up with access)
- Make sure you are in the "API Manager" section. You can check the hamburger menu on the lefthand site. Click **Credentials**. Under **OAuth 2.0 client IDs**, download **Axios Visuals Rig Copyflow Keys**.
- Move the downloaded file to the root folder `mv [DOWNLOADED FILE] ~/.axios_kit_google_client_secrets.json`
- The first time you run `gulp fetch-data` or `gulp gdrive:fetch`, you will be prompted to visit a URL and copy/paste an access token.

#### Adding files

Adding a new Google Drive file is easy with `gulp gdrive:add`. Just run the command and it will walk you through a series of prompts and will save your responses in the right place in `project.config.json`. You can pick between a document parsed with ArchieML and a spreadsheet parsed either as a table or as a key-value store.

#### Updating Data

Running `gulp fetch-data` or `gulp gdrive:fetch` will pull Google Drive sheets stored in your project config.
